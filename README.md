# Theory of phase field method
see phase field model.pdf for the basic concept and equation of phase field model

see Conditions.pdf for boundary condtion, initial condition and stability condition of model
 
# Calculation of phase field model
see Numerical method.pdf for discretization process for time and space

see Steps.pdf for the steps of simulation process

# Code
Code could be divided into three parts:set up, simulation and plot. In the setup part, people can change parameters for obtaining different result.

parameters.txt could be regarded as a guidance for changing parameters

# Examples
see timeevolution.png for an example simulation of the model

# Testing
see test files for testing the function of phase field euqation, temperature equation and anisotropy equation
