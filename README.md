# finite element method for phase field model
In  the circumstance of solidification of material at the undercooling state, there is a model called phase field model which could simulate this process well. Phase field model could replace the jump discontinuity or sharp interface by a smooth and continuous interface of very small width due to which the singularities involved in the sharp interface model are removed. 
In this model, there are two basic function controls the phase and temperature.
