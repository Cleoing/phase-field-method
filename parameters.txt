1.Calculation time
Range from 0 to 0.4, changing calculation time could see the process of crystal growth.
2.Relaxation time
Relaxation time is related to the branch and growth of edge, when relaxation time become smaller, the velocity of branch growth become faster.
Suggest ranging from 0.0001 to 0.0009
3.Anisotropic modulus
Anisotropic modulus effect the number of branch, suggest number 4,6,8.
4.Mean interface width
When mean interface width become larger, the velocity of branch growth become faster.
Suggest 0.009,0.01,0.011
5.Anisotropic strength
Anisotropic strength controls the shape of branch.
Suggested ranging from 0.005 to 0.05
6.Latent heat
The higher of lantent heat, the more heat spreaded form surface, and the branch become slimmer. 
Suggest ranging from 0.5 to 4.0
